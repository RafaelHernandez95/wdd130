    <p>Hi Everyone, i'm grateful for this class. I am a computer guy, but more so have experience with building them physically not really software wise haha. But very good to learn and know how to build sites since I always wondered how they were put together and what all the random words and symbols meant.</p> 
        
    <p>I'm into music, like djing and electronic dance music. However I am continuing to learn and practice that hobby on my free time. I live in Las vegas so there are shows through out the year. For work, I am an insurance sales producer. So I help with car and home policies through Allstate. I have been there for about 4 years now, but you always learn something new. I have no children nor am I married yet.</p> 
    
    <p>I am taking this course to elevate my learning when it comes to the IT field and computers in general, since it is something that calls my attention. But also because I would like a good paying job, that can support my future family. I'm pursuing the Applied Technology major, but we'll see. I have also thought about doing something medically, like sonographer since according to the internet it is one of the best paying medical jobs with the least amount of schooling.  </p>
